## Updating Firefox Color theme in AMO

https://addons.mozilla.org

1. "Export" theme in Firefox Color as `ff-color-L14.xpi`
2. Bump version:
    - `unzip ff-color-L14.xpi`
    - Edit version in `manifest.json`
3. Upload new version in AMO at `Manage My Submissions > My Themes`

## Using the theme

After approval, in the theme page, `View All`, newest version, click on the `xpi` file.

Installing from here, looks like the Firefox Color addon doesn't need to be installed at
all to use the theme.
